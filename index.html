      <h1>Hey everyone!</h1>
      
      <p>My name's Shane Brunswick, and I'm 17 years old. I’ve been an ardent Pokemon enthusiast since the first grade schoolyard. I’ve played ‘em all, caught ‘em all, and loved ‘em all since first adventuring the Sinnoh region with “Nacho” the Piplup at age six. Pokemon has been, and will always remain, my favorite video game / media franchise. So it is with no glee that I set out to make this satirical game criticizing Game Freak’s choice to exclude certain species of Pokemon from the next entries in the Pokemon series, Pokemon Sword & Shield. </p>
      <p>At its core, the fun of Pokemon is derived from the vast breadth of creatures there are to collect, train, and trade — this is encapsulated quite well by the legendary slogan, “gotta catch ‘em all”. But how can one catch ‘em all if “they’re” not all there to be caught? </p>
      <p>I set out to make this game to try to help in alerting Game Freak of just how much the Pokemon community wants to see the return of all previous 809 Pokemon. (#BringBackNationalDex!) We fans understand that programming and developing a new Pokemon game is by no means an easy task. Still, please understand! Fan don’t want to see any corners cut! So, with all that out of the way:</p>
